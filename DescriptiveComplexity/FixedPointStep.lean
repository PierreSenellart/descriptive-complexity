# Simultaneous first-order inductions: one skeleton for IFP and PFP

The inflationary (FO(IFP)) and partial (FO(PFP)) fixed-point logics differ in
exactly one place – what one application of the step formulas does with the
previous stage. Everything else is shared: the data (a block of relation
variables, one first-order step formula per variable, an output sentence), the
notion of a stage, stabilization on finite structures, transport along
isomorphisms, and the pullback along a first-order interpretation. This file
provides that shared skeleton; the logics themselves are built on it in
`DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPointInflationary` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPointPartial`.

## The data

A `DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef` over `L` bundles a block `B` of relation
variables, one step *formula* per variable – a first-order formula over
`L.sum B.lang` whose free variables are the arguments of the variable – and an
output sentence over the same expanded vocabulary. This is one *simultaneous*
induction with a first-order output; nesting is treated by stratification, in
`DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPointInflationary`.

Unlike `DescriptiveComplexity.LFPDef`, whose rules are clausal *data* (the
library's Horn-program normal form), the step formulas here are unrestricted:
positivity is exactly what the inflationary and partial iterations dispense
with. `LFPDef` keeps its clausal form – the two are bridged in
`DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPointInflationary` (rules give a `StepDef`) and
`DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPointInflationaryLFP` (the converse translation).

## The two iterations

* `DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.inflStage`: iterate
  `DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.inflStep`, which *accumulates* the step
  formulas into the previous stage. The stages grow, so on a finite structure
  they reach a fixed point within the atom count
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.isFixedPt_inflStep_card` – the height of the
  subset lattice, via
  `DescriptiveComplexity.exists_succ_eq_of_monotone_subset`), and their union
  `DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.inflLimit` equals the stage at the atom count
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.inflLimit_eq_stage_card`).
* `DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.partStage`: iterate
  `DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.next` itself, *replacing* the previous stage.
  Nothing grows, and the iteration may cycle forever; if some stage is a fixed
  point, all fixed stages are equal
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.partStage_eq_of_isFixedPt`) and one is
  reached within `Nat.card` of the *assignment* type – the pigeonhole
  `DescriptiveComplexity.isFixedPt_iterate_card_iff`, exposed here as
  `DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.exists_isFixedPt_partStage_iff`.

## Transport

Both iterations commute with transporting an assignment along an isomorphism
(`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.inflStage_map`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.partStage_map`) and with the pullback of the
block through a first-order interpretation
(`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.inflStage_pull`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.partStage_pull`, for the pulled definition
`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.pull`). Each is one commuting lemma about
`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.next` (`next_map`, `next_pull`) propagated along
the orbit; these are the load-bearing lemmas for isomorphism-invariance and
closure under reductions of every logic built on this skeleton.
