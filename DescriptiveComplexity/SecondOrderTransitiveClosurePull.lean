# Pulling SO(TC) definability back through an interpretation

SO(TC) definability is closed under (ordered) first-order reductions
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCDefinable.of_orderedReduction`). This is what makes
`DescriptiveComplexity.PSPACE` a `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass` rather than a
mere definability predicate.

## The walk on the interpreted structure, read on the base structure

A state of an SO(TC) walk is an assignment of a second-order block, so pulling
a specification back is *entirely* a matter of pulling its block back – there
are no tuples of elements and no modes to rearrange, unlike
`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.comap`. The block pullback of
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderPull` already supplies everything:

* the pulled block is `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.pull`, one `(n·d)`-ary relation
  variable on the base universe per `n`-tuple of tags;
* its assignments are in bijection with the assignments of the original block
  on the interpreted universe (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.pullAssignEquiv`,
  the two transfers `pullAssign`/`mergeAssign` being mutually inverse);
* the three sentences are pulled back by
  `DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.pullSentence` through the interpretation
  extended along the block – twice for the transition sentence, which sees two
  copies of the block.

The order enters as it does for the clausal fragments and for FO(TC): the
sentences live over the *ordered* expansion of the target vocabulary, so the
pullback goes through `DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.ordExtend`, which
interprets the target's order as the lexicographic order on tagged tuples, and
the interpreted structure is equipped with that same order
(`DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.mapLinearOrder`). Since SO(TC)
definability is required *for every* linear order, the lexicographic one is
available.

## The chain of transports

Each of the three correctness lemmas is the same three-step chain, read from
the interpreted side:

1. `DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.realize_pullSentence` – the pulled
   sentence on the base structure is the original on the interpreted one;
2. `DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.extendSOEquiv` – interpreting and then
   expanding by a block is expanding by the pulled block and then interpreting
   (once per copy of the block);
3. `DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.ordExtendLEquiv` – the order-extended
   interpretation produces the interpreted structure with the lexicographic
   order.

Steps 2 and 3 need the expansion of an isomorphism along a block that is
interpreted by the *same* assignment on both sides, which is
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.extendEquiv` at an identity map (its transport
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.mapAssign` along `Equiv.refl` is the identity, by
definitional eta).
