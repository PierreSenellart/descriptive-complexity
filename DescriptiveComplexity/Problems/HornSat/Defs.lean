# HORN-SAT: definition

The problem HORN-SAT, over the same vocabulary `FirstOrder.Language.sat` as SAT:
a CNF structure is a yes-instance iff every clause contains at most one
positive literal (`DescriptiveComplexity.AtMostOnePositive`) *and* the CNF is
satisfiable (`DescriptiveComplexity.HornSatisfiable`, bundled as
`DescriptiveComplexity.HORNSAT`).

Folding the Horn condition into the yes-instances rather than into the
vocabulary is the same choice as for 3SAT and its width bound
(`DescriptiveComplexity.WidthAtMostThree`): it keeps HORN-SAT a decision problem on
arbitrary `Language.sat`-structures, so that it lives in the same catalog and
composes with the same reductions.

Horn formulas are the tractable case of propositional satisfiability – a
satisfiable Horn formula has a *least* model, computed by unit propagation in
linear time ([Dowling & Gallier 1984][dowling1984linear]) – and HORN-SAT is the
canonical complete problem for polynomial time. The corresponding hardness
statement, machine-free and one level below the Cook–Levin discharge, is in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat.Hardness`.
