# The polynomial hierarchy, defined by second-order alternation

The levels `Σₖᵖ`/`Πₖᵖ` of the polynomial hierarchy for `k ≥ 1` – in
particular `NP = Σ₁ᵖ` and `coNP = Π₁ᵖ` – are *defined* here as
`ComplexityClass`es, via Fagin's ([Fagin 1974][fagin1974generalized]) and
Stockmeyer's ([Stockmeyer 1976][stockmeyer1976polynomial]) theorems: membership is
second-order definability with `k` alternating quantifier blocks
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable` / `DescriptiveComplexity.PiSODefinable`), and the closure
of membership under (ordered) FO reductions is provided by the pullback
theorems of `DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderPull` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderOrdered`.

Hardness is defined *cofinally*: `P` is hard when every problem of the class
reduces (by an ordered FO reduction) to every relational problem that `P`
itself reduces to. For a problem over a relational vocabulary this is
equivalent to the usual “everything in the class reduces to `P`”
(`DescriptiveComplexity.cofinalHard_iff`, with per-class specializations
`DescriptiveComplexity.hard_sigmaP_succ_iff`, `DescriptiveComplexity.hard_piP_succ_iff` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.hard_PTIME_iff`), and the formulation makes hardness travel
forward along reductions even through non-relational vocabularies.

Level 0 is `DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME`, polynomial time, *defined* here as
definability in the Horn fragment SO-Horn of existential second-order logic
([Grädel 1992][gradel1992capturing]) – the same move as defining NP by
`Σ₁`-definability, and equally a definition rather than an axiom: the library
declares **no axioms**, every theorem depending on nothing beyond Lean's
standard `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound` (check with
`#print axioms`). The order-free characterization of PTIME is the
Chandra–Harel/Gurevich problem and is not needed here: SO-Horn definability,
like ordered FO reductions, is stated over ordered structures.

**What level 0 does and does not give.** It is a genuine class, closed under
(ordered) FO reductions by the shape-preserving pullback of
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderHornPull`, and `Πₖᵖ` is the complements of `Σₖᵖ` at
*every* level (`DescriptiveComplexity.mem_piP_iff`) – at level 0 by definition, above
it by the quantifier duality.

All four inclusions of level 0 into level 1 are proved – `PTIME ⊆ NP`,
`PTIME ⊆ coNP` and their complements (`DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME_subset_NP`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME_subset_coNP`, `DescriptiveComplexity.coPTIME_subset_NP`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.coPTIME_subset_coNP`); they live downstream with HORN-SAT, since
they go through the Horn discharge and, for the two crossing ones, through the
certificate of Horn *un*satisfiability of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat.Unsat`.

That the two zeroth levels *coincide* – `PiP 0 = SigmaP 0`, polynomial time
closed under complement – is proved downstream, as
`DescriptiveComplexity.piP_zero_eq`: it is Grädel's capture theorem at level 0, and
its route is the logic-to-logic equivalence of SO-Horn with FO(LFP)
(`DescriptiveComplexity.lfpDefinable_iff_sigmaSOHornDefinable`, in
`DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPointHorn`), a full logic being closed under negation by
construction; no machine model is involved.

The level inclusions above 0, the duality `Πₖᵖ = co-Σₖᵖ` and the class `PH` are
all proved (`DescriptiveComplexity.sigmaP_subset_sigmaP_succ`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.mem_piP_iff`…).

/-- **Over a relational vocabulary, cofinal hardness is the usual notion**:
every problem of the collection reduces to `P` itself. This holds whatever the
collection is – the proof only uses reflexivity and transitivity of reductions
– so the specializations to the individual classes below
(`DescriptiveComplexity.hard_sigmaP_succ_iff`, `DescriptiveComplexity.hard_piP_succ_iff`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.hard_PTIME_iff`) are corollaries by definitional unfolding.

The left-to-right direction is what a *user* of a hardness result needs, to
extract an actual reduction; it is where relationality of `P` is used, to
instantiate the cofinal quantifier at `P` itself. -/

existential second-order logic ([Grädel 1992][gradel1992capturing]), which
captures polynomial time on ordered structures. It is a bona fide
`DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass` because SO-Horn definability is closed under
(ordered) first-order reductions – the Horn shape survives the pullback, see
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderHornPull`.

This is level 0 of the hierarchy below (`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaP`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.PiP`), and it has a complete problem, HORN-SAT
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HORNSAT_PTIME_complete`). That the class is closed under
complement – `PiP 0 = SigmaP 0` – is `DescriptiveComplexity.piP_zero_eq`, through the
equivalence with FO(LFP). -/
