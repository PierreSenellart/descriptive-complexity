# Descriptive complexity in Lean 4

A library for descriptive complexity built on Mathlib's `ModelTheory`:
machine-model-free hardness reductions and a logically-defined polynomial
hierarchy, in the style of Immerman's *Descriptive Complexity*
([Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive]).

Complexity theory is largely absent from Mathlib because formalizing a model
of computation with resource bounds is hard. The observation this library
rests on is that many classical NP-hardness reductions do not need the full
strength of a Turing machine: they are *first-order expressible*. An FO
reduction is computable in AC⁰ ⊆ LOGSPACE ⊆ PTIME, so exhibiting one is
strictly stronger than exhibiting a Karp reduction
([Karp 1972][karp1972reducibility]), while needing no machine model at all –
only first-order logic, which Mathlib already provides.

This page is the high-level map of the library, part by part. The `README`
gives the general pitch; the worked example in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Examples.ConjunctiveQueries` is the hands-on tutorial;
individual declarations are documented on their own pages.

## The framework: problems, interpretations, reductions

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Interpretation` – a `DescriptiveComplexity.DecisionProblem`
  is an isomorphism-invariant property of finite structures of a language
  (invariance is baked into the notion, as is standard in descriptive
  complexity). A `DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation` is a tagged,
  `dim`-dimensional first-order interpretation of one language in another,
  and a `DescriptiveComplexity.FOReduction` (notation `P ≤ᶠᵒ Q`) is one that
  maps yes-instances exactly to yes-instances. Tags replace the linear order
  that textbook FO reductions use to encode constantly-many sorts of
  elements.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Composition` – the pullback of a formula through an
  interpretation and the composition of interpretations, giving reflexivity
  and transitivity of `≤ᶠᵒ` (a `Preorder` on problems, usable in `calc`).
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Ordered` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.OrderedComposition` – reductions over the ordered
  expansion of the source language, `DescriptiveComplexity.OrderedFOReduction`
  (notation `P ≤ᶠᵒ[≤] Q`): order-invariant FO(≤) reductions, correct on every
  finite linearly ordered input. This is the standard notion of the field and
  the home of gadget constructions that genuinely need an order.

## The abstract complexity layer

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Complexity` – `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass`,
  with membership, hardness and completeness, closed by construction under
  (ordered) FO reductions. Membership and hardness depend only on the
  *finite* instances of a problem, making explicit that these statements say
  nothing about infinite structures.

## The polynomial hierarchy, defined logically

* `DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrder` (with `…Lift`, `…Pull`, `…Ordered`) –
  existential/universal second-order definability with `k` quantifier-block
  alternations.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Hierarchy` – the levels `Σₖᵖ`/`Πₖᵖ` and `PH` as
  complexity classes, via Fagin's ([Fagin 1974][fagin1974generalized]) and
  Stockmeyer's ([Stockmeyer 1976][stockmeyer1976polynomial]) theorems. The
  level inclusions and the duality `Πₖᵖ = co-Σₖᵖ` are proved,
  not assumed. Level 0 – polynomial time – is deliberately left as the *empty
  placeholder* class: no order-free logic is known to capture PTIME, and the
  ordered Immerman–Vardi characterization `P = FO(LFP)`
  ([Immerman 1986][immerman1986relational]; [Vardi 1982][vardi1982complexity])
  would require fixpoint logic and a built-in order. As a result the library
  declares **no axioms** (check with `#print axioms`).

## Shared encodings

* `DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderMerge` – merging a second-order quantifier
  prefix into a single block (and back), so that constructions stated for one
  block can read the kernel of a `k`-block sentence.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Padding` – canonically padded tuples: the convention
  by which a single interpretation dimension can carry tuples of different
  lengths (pad with a minimum of the input order), together with the FO(≤)
  formulas expressing it. This is the one place where the SAT-family
  reductions need their input to be ordered.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.OccurrenceOrder` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.OccurrenceFormulas` – machinery for encoding
  occurrences of literals in clauses, shared across the SAT-family reductions.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers` – unary and binary encodings of numbers as
  finite structures, for threshold and weight parameters of problems.

## The problem catalog

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems` – one decision problem per file: SAT with
  the Cook–Levin theorem ([Cook 1971][cook1971complexity];
  [Levin 1973][levin1973universal]) proved by a machine-free Tseitin discharge,
  3-colorability (FO-interreducible with SAT in both directions), 3SAT, and
  the clique family (Clique, Independent Set, Vertex Cover) with their
  inter-reductions and NP-completeness; TAUT, the tautology problem for
  formulas in disjunctive normal form, coNP-complete by complementing the
  Cook–Levin discharge; and `QBF k`, quantified Boolean formulas with `k`
  alternating blocks, complete for the `k`-th level of the hierarchy
  ([Stockmeyer 1976][stockmeyer1976polynomial]; [Wrathall
  1976][wrathall1976complete]) by the same Tseitin discharge carrying block
  marks.

## Worked examples

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Examples` – tutorial-style, domain-specific
  walkthroughs of the full recipe (vocabulary → semantics → invariance →
  membership → hardness → completeness). Currently Boolean conjunctive
  queries – evaluation and containment, both NP-complete via Chandra–Merlin
  ([Chandra & Merlin 1977][chandra1977optimal]).
