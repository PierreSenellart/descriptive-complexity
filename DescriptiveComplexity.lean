# Descriptive complexity in Lean 4

A library for descriptive complexity built on Mathlib's `ModelTheory`:
machine-model-free hardness reductions and a logically-defined polynomial
hierarchy, in the style of Immerman's *Descriptive Complexity*
([Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive]).

Complexity theory is largely absent from Mathlib because formalizing a model
of computation with resource bounds is hard. The observation this library
rests on is that many classical NP-hardness reductions do not need the full
strength of a Turing machine: they are *first-order expressible*. An FO
reduction is computable in AC⁰ ⊆ LOGSPACE ⊆ PTIME, so exhibiting one is
strictly stronger than exhibiting a Karp reduction
([Karp 1972][karp1972reducibility]), while needing no machine model at all –
only first-order logic, which Mathlib already provides.

This page is the high-level map of the library, part by part. The `README`
gives the general pitch; the worked example in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Examples.ConjunctiveQueries` is the hands-on tutorial;
individual declarations are documented on their own pages.

## The framework: problems, interpretations, reductions

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Interpretation` – a `DescriptiveComplexity.DecisionProblem`
  is an isomorphism-invariant property of finite structures of a language
  (invariance is baked into the notion, as is standard in descriptive
  complexity). A `DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation` is a tagged,
  `dim`-dimensional first-order interpretation of one language in another,
  and a `DescriptiveComplexity.FOReduction` (notation `P ≤ᶠᵒ Q`) is one that
  maps yes-instances exactly to yes-instances. Tags replace the linear order
  that textbook FO reductions use to encode constantly-many sorts of
  elements.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Composition` – the pullback of a formula through an
  interpretation and the composition of interpretations, giving reflexivity
  and transitivity of `≤ᶠᵒ` (a `Preorder` on problems, usable in `calc`).
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Ordered` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.OrderedComposition` – reductions over the ordered
  expansion of the source language, `DescriptiveComplexity.OrderedFOReduction`
  (notation `P ≤ᶠᵒ[≤] Q`): order-invariant FO(≤) reductions, correct on every
  finite linearly ordered input. This is the standard notion of the field and
  the home of gadget constructions that genuinely need an order.

## The abstract complexity layer

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Complexity` – `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass`,
  with membership, hardness and completeness, closed by construction under
  (ordered) FO reductions. Membership and hardness depend only on the
  *finite* instances of a problem, making explicit that these statements say
  nothing about infinite structures.

## The polynomial hierarchy, defined logically

* `DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrder` (with `…Lift`, `…Pull`, `…Ordered`) –
  existential/universal second-order definability with `k` quantifier-block
  alternations.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Hierarchy` – the levels `Σₖᵖ`/`Πₖᵖ` and `PH` as
  complexity classes, via Fagin's ([Fagin 1974][fagin1974generalized]) and
  Stockmeyer's ([Stockmeyer 1976][stockmeyer1976polynomial]) theorems. The
  level inclusions and the duality `Πₖᵖ = co-Σₖᵖ` are proved, not assumed.
  Level 0 is `DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME`, polynomial time, defined by the Horn
  fragment SO-Horn (below); the level-0 statements that would amount to
  closure under complement are the one thing the fragment does not give, and
  are restricted to levels `≥ 1`. Everything remains a definition or a
  theorem: the library declares **no axioms** (check with `#print axioms`).

## Polynomial time, by the Horn fragment

* `DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderHorn` – SO-Horn ([Grädel
  1992][gradel1992capturing]): existential second-order logic whose kernel is a
  conjunction of Horn clauses in the quantified relation variables, the
  fragment that captures polynomial time on ordered structures. The kernel is
  represented as *data* (`DescriptiveComplexity.HornProgram`, a list of clauses with a
  first-order guard over the ordered expansion, body atoms and an optional
  head), which is Grädel's clausal normal form and what a reduction consuming
  such a definition needs to read.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderHornPull` – the pullback of an SO-Horn definition
  through an interpretation *stays Horn*: the Horn condition constrains only
  the second-order atoms, and an interpretation rewrites the
  input-vocabulary ones, which live in the guard. This closure is what makes
  `DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME` (in `DescriptiveComplexity.Hierarchy`) a genuine complexity
  class, and hence level 0 of the hierarchy, *defined* by SO-Horn definability
  just as NP is defined by `Σ₁`-definability. HORN-SAT is PTIME-complete – hard
  by the Horn discharge, and a member by the Horn program that computes unit
  propagation along the order – which also yields the four inclusions of level
  0 into level 1. See `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat` for what is and is not
  claimed.

* `DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPoint` – FO(LFP) ([Immerman
  1986][immerman1986relational]; [Vardi 1982][vardi1982complexity]), in the same
  clausal style: a rule system defining a least fixed point, plus an
  *unrestricted* first-order output sentence read at it. Because the output may
  negate fixed-point atoms, FO(LFP) definability is closed under complement by
  construction (`DescriptiveComplexity.LFPDefinable.compl`) – the one thing the Horn
  fragment cannot do head-on – and every SO-Horn definition transports into it
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOHornDefinable.lfpDefinable`).

* `DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPointHorn` – the converse translation, the hard half of
  Grädel's equivalence: every FO(LFP) definition compiles back into the Horn
  fragment, by deriving the *complement* of the fixed point stage by stage
  along the order and evaluating the output sentence clausewise
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.LFPDefinable.sigmaSOHornDefinable`). The two formalisms are
  therefore interchangeable
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.lfpDefinable_iff_sigmaSOHornDefinable`), SO-Horn definability
  is closed under complement (`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOHornDefinable.compl`), and
  level 0 of the hierarchy collapses: `PiP 0 = SigmaP 0`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.piP_zero_eq`), polynomial time closed under complement. The
  order-walking machinery shared with the HORN-SAT program lives in
  `DescriptiveComplexity.OrderWalk`.

## Shared encodings

* `DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderMerge` – merging a second-order quantifier
  prefix into a single block (and back), so that constructions stated for one
  block can read the kernel of a `k`-block sentence.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Padding` – canonically padded tuples: the convention
  by which a single interpretation dimension can carry tuples of different
  lengths (pad with a minimum of the input order), together with the FO(≤)
  formulas expressing it. This is the one place where the SAT-family
  reductions need their input to be ordered.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.OccurrenceOrder` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.OccurrenceFormulas` – machinery for encoding
  occurrences of literals in clauses, shared across the SAT-family reductions.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.OrderWalk` – walking a finite linear order (or the
  lexicographic order on tuples) first-order: min/max/successor guards and
  their tuple analogues, induction along covers, and the rank of an element.
  Shared between the HORN-SAT program and the FO(LFP) → SO-Horn translation.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers` – unary and binary encodings of numbers as
  finite structures, for threshold and weight parameters of problems.

## The problem catalog

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems` – one decision problem per file: SAT with
  the Cook–Levin theorem ([Cook 1971][cook1971complexity];
  [Levin 1973][levin1973universal]) proved by a machine-free Tseitin discharge,
  3-colorability (FO-interreducible with SAT in both directions), 3SAT,
  NAE-SAT with its width-three restriction NAE-3SAT, and 1-in-SAT – the
  Schaefer-style variants ([Schaefer 1978][schaefer1978complexity]) that make
  convenient reduction sources: the first two reuse the SAT/3SAT
  interpretations unchanged, only the notion of satisfaction differing, and
  the third normalizes every clause to three slots, so that one gadget covers
  every width at once – and
  the clique family (Clique, Independent Set, Vertex Cover) with their
  inter-reductions and NP-completeness; the coloring family – `k`-colorability
  for every `k ≥ 3` by padding 3-colorability with blown-up universal
  vertices, then Chromatic Number and Clique Cover, whose threshold is a
  *number of colors*, so that their membership guesses a coloring by the
  marked elements themselves; Subgraph Isomorphism, where an injective
  homomorphism of a pattern graph into a host graph generalizes Clique; the
  set family – Set Cover, Hitting Set and Set Packing on a bipartite
  incidence vocabulary, the first two transposes of
  each other, all three NP-hard by reading a graph as the incidence system of
  its edges ([Karp 1972][karp1972reducibility]), and Exact Cover on that same
  vocabulary, where exactness replaces the threshold and hardness comes from
  exactly-one satisfiability with no gadget and no counting; Feedback Vertex Set and
  Feedback Arc Set, NP-hard by symmetrizing the arcs of a digraph and then
  splitting its vertices, with a first-order certificate of acyclicity (a
  guessed strict partial order) for their membership and a threshold carried
  by a marked *binary* relation for the second; Max Cut, on that same
  arc-marked vocabulary, hard from NAE-3SAT by a gadget needing neither edge
  weights nor parallel edges – the cut is read as the ordered pairs crossing
  it, and the whole counting argument is one injective charge map from the cut
  to the marks; Steiner Tree in both its node- and its
  edge-weighted reading, the connectivity condition certified first-order by a
  guessed root and order, from which the `n − 1` edge bound also follows;
  TAUT, the tautology problem for
  formulas in disjunctive normal form, coNP-complete by complementing the
  Cook–Levin discharge; `QBF k`, quantified Boolean formulas with `k`
  alternating blocks, complete for the `k`-th level of the hierarchy
  ([Stockmeyer 1976][stockmeyer1976polynomial]; [Wrathall
  1976][wrathall1976complete]) by the same Tseitin discharge carrying block
  marks; HORN-SAT, PTIME-complete by the Horn discharge and a Horn program for
  unit propagation – the P-level analogue of Cook–Levin, equally machine-free;
  and REACH/UNREACH, whose Horn program is a second worked instance of the
  fragment.

## Worked examples

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Examples` – tutorial-style, domain-specific
  walkthroughs of the full recipe (vocabulary → semantics → invariance →
  membership → hardness → completeness). Currently Boolean conjunctive
  queries – evaluation and containment, both NP-complete via Chandra–Merlin
  ([Chandra & Merlin 1977][chandra1977optimal]).
