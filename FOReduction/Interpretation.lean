# First-order interpretations and FO reductions

Complexity theory is essentially absent from Mathlib because formalizing a
machine model of computation (and resource bounds on it) is hard. However, many
classical NP-hardness reductions do not need the full power of polynomial-time
computation: the reduction is *first-order expressible* — the output structure
can be described by fixed first-order formulas evaluated in the input
structure. Such FO reductions are computable in AC⁰ ⊆ LOGSPACE ⊆ PTIME, so
exhibiting an FO reduction is (much) stronger than exhibiting a Karp
reduction, while being completely machine-model-free and therefore easy to
formalize on top of Mathlib's `ModelTheory` library.

This file defines:

* `FirstOrder.StructureProp L`: a "problem" over the vocabulary `L`, i.e. a
  property of `L`-structures;
* `FirstOrder.FOInterpretation L L' Tag dim`: a tagged, `dim`-dimensional
  first-order interpretation of a relational language `L'` in a language `L`,
  mapping every `L`-structure `A` to an `L'`-structure `I.Map A` with universe
  `Tag × (Fin dim → A)`;
* `FirstOrder.FOInterpretation.IsQuantifierFree`: interpretations all of whose
  defining formulas are quantifier-free (an even weaker reduction notion);
* `FirstOrder.FOReduction P Q`: an FO reduction from problem `P` to problem
  `Q`, i.e. an interpretation mapping yes-instances of `P` exactly to
  yes-instances of `Q`.

## Design notes

The textbook notion of FO reduction maps a structure `A` to a structure with
universe a definable subset of `A^k`, using a linear order on `A` to encode
constantly many "sorts" of elements. To stay order-free and subset-free we
instead tag tuples with elements of a finite type `Tag`, and use the full
universe `Tag × A^dim`: junk elements are harmless in practice because the
defining formulas can exclude them from all relations. Every tagged
interpretation can be converted into a textbook `k`-ary FO reduction on
ordered structures (using the order to encode constantly many tags), so the
notion formalized here is a genuine form of FO reducibility.

The universe of `I.Map A` is `Tag × (Fin dim → A)`, which is finite whenever
`A` and `Tag` are (`FOInterpretation.map_finite`): FO reductions map finite
structures to finite structures, as required for reductions between decision
problems on finite structures.

for the `j`-th coordinate `āᵢ j` of the `i`-th argument — holds in `A`. -/

Since FO interpretations are computable in AC⁰ ⊆ PTIME on (encodings of)
finite structures, an `FOReduction P Q` is in particular a Karp reduction from
`P` to `Q`: any NP-hardness argument for `P` transfers to `Q`, without any
formalized machine model. -/
