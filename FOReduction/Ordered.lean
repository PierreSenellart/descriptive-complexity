# Ordered first-order reductions

Textbook FO reductions (Immerman, "Descriptive Complexity", ch. 3) operate on
*ordered* finite structures: the input structure comes with a linear order on
its universe, which the defining formulas may mention. The order is essential
for many reductions: e.g. reducing SAT to 3-colorability threads an OR-gadget
chain along the order of each clause's literals, which no order-free
first-order interpretation can express.

This file provides the ordered variant of `FirstOrder.FOReduction`:

* an `(L.sum Language.order).Structure` instance on any linearly ordered
  `L`-structure, realizing the extra binary symbol `leSymb` as `≤`;
* `FirstOrder.OrderedFOReduction P Q`: a first-order interpretation of `L'` in
  the ordered expansion `L.sum Language.order`, mapping yes-instances of `P`
  exactly to yes-instances of `Q` — for every *finite* linearly ordered input
  structure. Finiteness matters: gadget constructions traverse the order and
  need minima, maxima and successors.

Since the problem `P` does not mention the order and correctness is required
for *every* linear order on the input structure, an `OrderedFOReduction` is
what descriptive complexity calls an order-invariant FO reduction.

/-- An *ordered* first-order reduction from the problem `P` (on
`L`-structures) to the problem `Q` (on `L'`-structures): a first-order
interpretation over the ordered expansion of `L` that maps yes-instances of
`P` exactly to yes-instances of `Q`, for every finite linearly ordered input
structure.

As `P` does not depend on the order, correctness for every linear order makes
this an order-invariant FO reduction; it is computable in AC⁰ ⊆ PTIME on
(encodings of) finite ordered structures, hence in particular a Karp
reduction. -/
