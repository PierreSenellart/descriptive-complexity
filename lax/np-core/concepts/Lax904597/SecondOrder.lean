title: Second-order definability with bounded alternation
type: definition
---
A second-order quantifier *block* is a finite family of relation variables
with given arities. A first-order sentence over the vocabulary expanded by
$k$ blocks, read with the blocks quantified alternately, is a $\Sigma_k$
sentence when the first block is existential and a $\Pi_k$ sentence when it
is universal; a decision problem is $\Sigma_k$- or $\Pi_k$-definable when
such a sentence defines it on nonempty finite structures. No object-level
second-order syntax is needed: a block is instantiated by an assignment of
actual relations, which turns it into a structure over the block's own
vocabulary, and only the first-order kernel is a Lean-level sentence.

$\Sigma_1$-definability is existential second-order logic, and by Fagin's
theorem the $\Sigma_1$-definable problems are exactly NP. This is how NP is
defined in this submission: as $\Sigma_1$-definability, with no machine
model.
