title: GAME is PTIME-complete
type: theorem
---
GAME, alternating reachability, is PTIME-complete under first-order
reductions. It is FO(LFP) definable, the winning positions being a least
fixed point, hence in PTIME. Hardness reads unit propagation as a game,
which the existential player wins exactly when the Horn formula is
unsatisfiable: the complement of HORN-SAT reduces to GAME, and PTIME is
closed under complement.
