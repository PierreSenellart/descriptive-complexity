title: Exponential expansions
type: definition
---
An exponential expansion maps a finite ordered $L$-structure $A$ to a
structure over another vocabulary $E$ whose universe is a definable set of
tagged assignments of a block of second-order variables: a tag $t$ and an
assignment $\rho$ of the block form a point when the domain sentence of $t$
holds of $\rho$, and each symbol of $E$ holds of points when its defining
sentence, at their tags, holds of $A$ with one copy of the block per
argument interpreted by their assignments. A block with a variable of arity
$a$ has $2^{n^a}$ assignments over $n$ elements, so the expanded universe is
one exponential larger; the expansion is described by first-order sentences.
