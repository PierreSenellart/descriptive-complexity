# First-order reductions in Lean 4

Machine-model-free hardness reductions on top of Mathlib's `ModelTheory`
library, in the style of descriptive complexity (Immerman, *Descriptive
Complexity*, ch. 3).

Complexity theory is essentially absent from Lean/Mathlib because formalizing
a model of computation with resource bounds is hard. But many classical
NP-hardness reductions do not need the full power of PTIME: they are
*first-order expressible*. An FO reduction is computable in AC⁰ ⊆ LOGSPACE ⊆
PTIME, so exhibiting one is strictly stronger than exhibiting a Karp
reduction, while requiring no machine model at all: only first-order logic,
which Mathlib already has.

As far as we know this is the first use of FO-expressible reductions in a
proof assistant (the closest prior work is the "cookbook reductions" of
Grange, Vehlken, Vortmeier and Zeume, MFCS 2024, which uses FO-definable
reductions in an automated-verification/teaching setting, not an ITP).

Both directions between SAT and 3-colorability are formalized: an order-free,
quantifier-free reduction 3COL → SAT, and an ordered FO reduction SAT → 3COL
(the classical gadget construction, which genuinely needs a linear order on
the input structure to thread each clause's OR-gadget chain). SAT and
3-colorability are thus FO-interreducible.

## Contents

* `FOReduction/Interpretation.lean` — the framework:
  - `FirstOrder.DecisionProblem L`: a decision problem as an
    isomorphism-invariant property of `L`-structures (invariance is part of
    the notion, as in descriptive complexity);
  - `FirstOrder.FOInterpretation L L' Tag dim`: tagged `dim`-dimensional
    first-order interpretations of a relational language `L'` in `L`, sending
    an `L`-structure `A` to an `L'`-structure `I.Map A` on `Tag × A^dim`
    (tags replace the linear order used by textbook FO reductions to encode
    constantly many sorts of elements);
  - `FirstOrder.FOInterpretation.IsQuantifierFree`: quantifier-free
    interpretations;
  - `FirstOrder.FOReduction P Q`, with notation `P ≤ᶠᵒ Q`: FO reductions
    between problems, i.e. interpretations mapping yes-instances exactly to
    yes-instances;
  - `FirstOrder.FOInterpretation.map_finite`: finite structures map to finite
    structures.
* `FOReduction/Problems.lean` — the problems:
  - the language `FirstOrder.Language.sat` of CNF instances (`isClause`,
    `posIn`, `negIn`) and satisfiability `FirstOrder.Satisfiable`;
  - 3-colorability `FirstOrder.ThreeColorable` over Mathlib's
    `FirstOrder.Language.graph`, shown to agree with Mathlib's
    `SimpleGraph.Colorable 3` on simple graphs.
* `FOReduction/Composition.lean` — transitivity:
  - `FirstOrder.FOInterpretation.pull`: pullback of a formula through an
    interpretation (quantifiers over the interpreted universe become finite
    conjunctions over tags of blocks of quantifiers);
  - `FirstOrder.FOInterpretation.comp`: composition of FO interpretations,
    with `compLEquiv` identifying the composite universe with the
    twice-interpreted one;
  - `FirstOrder.FOReduction.refl` and `FirstOrder.FOReduction.trans`:
    FO reducibility is reflexive (identity interpretation) and transitive,
    with a `Trans` instance for `calc` chains and a `Preorder` instance on
    `DecisionProblem L` (for relational `L`) where `P ≤ Q` is the
    propositional truncation `Nonempty (P ≤ᶠᵒ Q)`.
* `FOReduction/Ordered.lean` — ordered machinery:
  - an `(L.sum Language.order).Structure` instance on linearly ordered
    `L`-structures, and `FirstOrder.OrderedFOReduction P Q`, with notation
    `P ≤ᶠᵒ[≤] Q`: FO reductions over the ordered expansion of the source
    language, correct for every finite linearly ordered input structure
    (i.e. order-invariant FO(≤) reductions, the standard notion of
    descriptive complexity).
* `FOReduction/ThreeColToSat.lean` — the reduction 3COL ⟶ SAT:
  - `FirstOrder.threeColToSat`: the classical CNF encoding of 3-colorability
    (variables `xᵤᵢ` "vertex `u` gets color `i`"; per-vertex clauses
    `xᵤ₀ ∨ xᵤ₁ ∨ xᵤ₂`; per-edge, per-color clauses `¬xᵤᵢ ∨ ¬xᵥᵢ`) as a
    2-dimensional interpretation with 7 tags;
  - `FirstOrder.threeColorable_iff_satisfiable`: correctness, for
    arbitrary (not necessarily finite, simple or undirected) graph
    structures;
  - `FirstOrder.threeCol_fo_reduction_sat : ThreeCol ≤ᶠᵒ SAT` — the
    `fo_reduction` theorem;
  - `FirstOrder.threeColToSat_isQuantifierFree`: the reduction is even
    quantifier-free;
  - `FirstOrder.SimpleGraph.colorable_iff_satisfiable`: the corollary for
    Mathlib simple graphs.
* `FOReduction/Complexity.lean` — abstract complexity:
  - `FirstOrder.ComplexityClass`: abstract complexity classes (membership
    `P ∈ 𝒞`, hardness `𝒞.Hard P`, completeness `𝒞.Complete P`, inclusion
    `𝒞 ⊆ 𝒟`), closed by definition under (ordered) FO reductions — closure
    is part of the structure since an axiom over all classes would be
    inconsistent; membership and hardness moreover only depend on the
    *finite* instances of a problem (`mem_congr_finite`/`hard_congr_finite`),
    making explicit that complexity statements say nothing about infinite
    structures;
  - the polynomial hierarchy, axiomatized: `SigmaP k`/`PiP k` with
    `PTIME := SigmaP 0`, `NP := SigmaP 1`, `coNP := PiP 1`, the level
    inclusions, `Π₀ᵖ = Σ₀ᵖ`, and `Πₖᵖ` = complements (`Pᶜ`) of `Σₖᵖ`; all
    axioms hold in the trivial model, so they are jointly consistent; `PH`
    is defined from the levels;
  - `FirstOrder.SAT_NP_complete` (Cook–Levin, axiom), and the derived
    theorems `threeCol_mem_NP`, `threeCol_NP_hard`, and
    **`threeCol_NP_complete : NP.Complete ThreeCol`** — NP-completeness of
    3-colorability from the two FO reductions, with no machine model.
* `FOReduction/OccurrenceOrder.lean`, `FOReduction/SatGadget.lean`,
  `FOReduction/SatToThreeCol.lean` — the reverse reduction SAT ⟶ 3COL:
  - literal occurrences of a clause and their traversal along the order
    (first/last occurrence, immediate predecessor), with existence lemmas on
    finite universes;
  - the gadget graph (palette triangle with copy-rigidity, literal vertices,
    per-occurrence OR-gate chains, unit-clause forcing, empty-clause
    spoiler) and the combinatorial proof
    `SatToCol.satisfiable_iff_gadColoring` that it is 3-colorable iff the
    CNF is satisfiable;
  - FO(≤) formulas defining the gadget graph, their realization lemmas, and
    `FirstOrder.sat_ordered_fo_reduction_threeCol : SAT ≤ᶠᵒ[≤] ThreeCol` —
    the reverse `fo_reduction` theorem.

## Notes

* The direction 3COL → SAT is order-free and even quantifier-free; the gadget
  direction SAT → 3COL is *not* FO-expressible without a linear order on the
  input structure (clauses of unbounded width require an ordered traversal),
  so it is formalized as an ordered (order-invariant) FO reduction, correct
  for every finite linearly ordered input. Natural next steps: a catalog of
  classical NP-complete problems with their FO reductions (3SAT, Vertex
  Cover, Clique, Independent Set, …), composition involving ordered
  reductions, and `BIT`/arithmetic on ordered structures (under which SAT is
  complete for NP under FO reductions, Immerman).
* Junk elements of the interpreted universe (tags with non-diagonal or
  non-edge tuples) are excluded from all relations by the defining formulas,
  so no domain formula is needed.
